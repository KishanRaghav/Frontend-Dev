            <h2>Importance of Good Typography</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Typography</strong> plays a major role in how users consume information on the web. 
                A well-designed text layout improves readability, visual appeal, and user experience.
                <em>Styling text</em> using spacing, alignment and font variations enhances clarity. 
                Additionally, <mark>highlighted text</mark> can help draw attention to key points.
            </p>

            <p>
                Good typography ensures that content is easy to read and visually balanced.  
                Designers often experiment with <strong>font-weights</strong>, <em>font-styles</em>, and 
                different font families to create hierarchy and structure.
